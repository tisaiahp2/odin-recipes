        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 x 1.5kg chicken, backbone removed and spatchcocked. <em>Ask your butcher about the meat being spatchcocked</em></li>
            <li>mixed salad or coleslaw, to serve with</li>
         </ul>
            <h2>For the Jerk Marinade</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>225g onions, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>2 small Scotch bonnet chillies, halved and de-seeded</li>
            <li>50g fresh root ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3-cm piece of fresh turmeric root, peeled and roughly chopped. Or use 1 tbsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground allspice</li>
            <li>15g fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>120ml white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>120ml dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method/Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, make the marinade. Place all the ingredients, except the seasoning, into a food processor and pulse until smooth. Season with a little salt and a geneous grinding of black pepper.</li>
            <li>Cut slashes into the smooth side of the spatchcocked chicken so that the marinade can penetrate the flesh and place the chicken in a shallow dish. Pour over the marinade and rub well into the meat. Cover and chill for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight, turning every now and then.</li>
            <li>Preheat a barbecue with a lid and take the chicken out of the fridge to come up to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken on the hot barbecue with the lid down for 40-50 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with any leftover marinade, until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a thin metal skewer.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the heat and rest for a few minutes, then serve with a simple mixed salad or a traditional crunchy coleslaw.</li>
        </ol>
